No one and you
Bad days will pass
Love you just because
Can you give me hug
Your dream is not dream
Dream as if you never wake up
Things do not change we change
Let time to my deep love man
In your arms I feel so happy
Back to the past can not return to the original
Doomed eternally also want to walk with you
Would like to have a heart you will not leave
Do not give up is not dead heart
A person a city a lifetime of love
You are always so beautiful in your heart
To have a strong dare not forget
Years cardamom who made who the end of life
Lively is their I have nothing
The fairy tale has ended forgetting is happiness.
Look me in the eyes baby I love you
Thank you for your unfeeling let me learn to forget
Like you really is I insist on the most long thing
Happy is the man who is living by his hobby
we are never ever getting back together
Complaining does not solve anything
Your name my mind
There will be an angel to love you for me
